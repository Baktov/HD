## Special Features

**_Amphibious_**. The dragon can breathe air and water.

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)_**. If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

**_Multiattack_**. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**_Bite_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.

**_Claw_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage.

**_Tail_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage.

**_Frightful Presence_**. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**_Poison Breath (Recharge 5-6)_**. The dragon exhales poisonous gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 56 (16d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**_Detect_**. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**_Tail Attack_**. The dragon makes a tail attack.

**_Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions)_**. The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
