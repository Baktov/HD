## Special Features

**_Brave_**. The knight has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.

## Actions

**_Multiattack_**. The knight makes two melee attacks.

**_Greatsword_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage.

**_Heavy Crossbow_**. Ranged Weapon Attack: +2 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 5 (1d10) piercing damage.

**_Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest)_**. For 1 minute, the knight can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the knight. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. This effect ends if the knight is incapacitated.

## Reactions

**_Parry_**. The knight adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the knight must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
