* The creature drops whatever it's holding and falls [prone](srd_conditions_prone.md).

* The creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.

* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage.

* Any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
