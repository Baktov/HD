# Grappled

- Alias: [Empoigné](hd_conditions_empoigne.md)
- Source: (SRD p358)

* A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.

* The condition ends if the grappler is [incapacitated](srd_conditions_incapacitated.md) (see the condition).

* The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the [thunder-wave](srd_spells_thunderwave.md) spell.
