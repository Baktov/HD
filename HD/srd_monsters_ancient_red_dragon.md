## Special Features

**_Legendary Resistance (3/Day)_**. If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

## Actions

**_Multiattack_**. The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

**_Bite_**. Melee Weopon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 21 (2d10 + 10) piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) fire damage.

**_Claw_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 17 (2d6 + 10) slashing damage.

**_Tail_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +17 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 19 (2d8 + 10) bludgeoning damage.

**_Frightful Presence_**. Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

**_Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6)_**. The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Legendary Actions

The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**_Detect_**. The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

**_Tail Attack_**. The dragon makes a tail attack.

**_Wing Attack (Costs 2 actions)_**. The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
