## Special Features

**_Death Throes_**. When the balor dies, it explodes, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The explosion ignites flammable objects in that area that aren't being worn or carried, and it destroys the balor's weapons.

**_Fire Aura_**. At the start of each of the balor's turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and flammable objects in the aura that aren't being worn or carried ignite. A creature that touches the balor or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.

**_Magic Resistance_**. The balor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**_Magic Weapons_**. The balor's weapon attacks are magical.

## Actions

**_Multiattack_**. The balor makes two attacks: one with its longsword and one with its whip.

**_Longsword_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 21 (3d8 + 8) slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage. If the balor scores a critical hit, it rolls damage dice three times, instead of twice.

**_Whip_**. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward the balor.

**_Teleport_**. The balor magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
