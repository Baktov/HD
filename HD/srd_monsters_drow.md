At will: _[dancing lights](srd_spells_dancing_lights.md)_

1/day each: _[darkness](srd_spells_darkness.md), [faerie fire](srd_spells_faerie_fire.md)_

_Hit_: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage.

**_Hand Crossbow_**. Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target.

_Hit_: 5 (1d6 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also unconscious while poisoned in this way. The target wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
