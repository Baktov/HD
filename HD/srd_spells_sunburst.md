### Description

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is [blinded](srd_conditions_blinded.md) for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't [blinded](srd_conditions_blinded.md) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature [blinded](srd_conditions_blinded.md) by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer [blinded](srd_conditions_blinded.md).

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.
